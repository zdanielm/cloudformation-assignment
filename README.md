## Create a Cloudformation template that will create a virtual machine and a database (RDS)! 
1. The virtual machine should communicate with the database on the default MySql port 3306. 
2. The virtual machine (EC2) is only accessible on port 22. 
3. The database and the virtual machine can only communicate on port 3306, this should be implemented using 2 Security Groups. 
4. Furthermore, a(n) msql client should be installed on the virtual machine (preferably Linux) to test the connection between the virtual machine and the RDS database.
